If you want to open files in PHPStorm8 directly from the Symfony debug toolbar there is a neat trick you can use. This is very helpful when you quickly want to find a controller or when you got an exception.


{% highlight javascript %}
// /app/config/config.yml
framework:
  ide: "phpstorm://open?file=%%f&line=%%l"
{% endhighlight %}


And that is pretty much it. You dont need to install PhpStormOpener, LinCastor or any other Apple script. This will work with PHPStorm8, Symfony2.6 and Mac OSX. Below is a picture to show where you should click to make PHPStorm open the controller used in this request.
